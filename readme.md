# Welcome To The Iron Yard - Front End Engineering #

I hope you all are as excited as I am about getting this class started. It is in the best interest of everyone to make sure you as prepared as possible for the coming twelve weeks. Through large amounts of hard work and determination, you will learn, grow, and achieve.

The follow items are a list of tasks I would have each of you complete before our first class on the 22nd. The vast majority of these are simple setup items or resources to help expose you to terms and tools.

If you have any questions or confusion about these tasks, please email me so I can help you work through them.

Remember, we are all in this together. We will have individual assignments and group assignments. Always be willing and ready to help your peers.

Thank you for your committment and hard work. It will be rewarded.

### Setup Tasks

* Read the [Honesty Policy](https://github.com/tiy-tampa-bay-js/Onboarding/blob/master/honesty.md), [Homework Policy](https://github.com/tiy-tampa-bay-js/Onboarding/blob/master/homework.md), and  [Communication Policy](https://github.com/tiy-tampa-bay-js/Onboarding/blob/master/communication.md).
* We will be spending a lot of time using GitHub (http://github.com), so before class starts, go ahead and sign up for an account and go through the "Hello World" introduction (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). That will get you ready to jump in on the first day. Email me (justin@theironyard.com) the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group that we will be using for class.

* Believe it or not, a lot of time in the first weeks of programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try http://www.keybr.com/). If you already know how to touch type, I would highly recommend working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io. Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.

* We will be using [Codepen.io](http://Codepen.io) for a few assignments. Codepen is also a great tool for sharing codesnippets with others. Go ahead and sign up for an account there and explore a little bit.

* Everyone is going to need a good text editor and I recommend downloading [Atom](https://atom.io/) and getting that installed. 

* We will be using the terminal a bit, so go ahead and download [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) and have that installed. Don't worry about knowing what to do with it, we'll go over that in class. 

* Additionally: Get [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) and [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to make your OSX experience better.

### Learning Tasks
The following is a list of videos that are geared towards developers who have had this as a career for several years. You are under no expectation to understand everything that is being said or relate to the issues they are bringing up. These videos are meant to exposure to some programming terminology, computer science terms, and give a glimpse into career of software developers. I also hope they get you excited and pique your interest in these areas. I will confess that I enjoy all these videos very much, but I don't expect you all to like them as much.
What I would like for everyone to do is watch these videos and write down any questions that you have while watching. Pause if you need to. If you don't know a term or acronym, write it down. If any of these videos spark a different question, write that down too. Once you've finished with the videos, see if you can find answers for those questions. These questions and videos will hopefully spur some great discussions in class.
__NSFW__ language may be present in some of these. _Dont attempt to watch all of these in a single day or sitting, it'll burn you out. Try to spread them out over a few days._

* (http://codon.com/impossible-programs) [41mins] There are some programs we can never build.
* (https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) [30mins] A humorous look at the 40 year history of a 19 year old language
* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY) [28mins] Dealing with failure, success, stress, and imposter syndrome.
* (http://codon.com/compilers-for-free) [41mins] A high level talk about programming, metaprogramming, and compilers. Warning: Here be Math. This talk may seem intimiating, but think of it as fun.
* (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyL9EC0S0c) [66mins] This is the long one. Don't let the title get you down, its a very inspiring talk. Lessons on learning programming, life in programming, and cultural biases in programming.
* (http://vimeo.com/54042336) [33mins] A talk about culture, paradigms, and life. 


After you've finished with the videos I'd like for you to sign up [General Assembly](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) and work through the first project by yourself. This will be what we cover in the first day of class and having this initial experience to the material will be very helpful when getting up to speed.
